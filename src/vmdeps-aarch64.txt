# openEuler qemu package does not specify the requirement for edk2-aarch64, but it must be needed.
# Due to improper placement of the edk2 package in the openEuler repo, it is temporarily placed here. 
# After waiting for the openEuler repo to be fixed, move it into deps.txt or after qemu-system-aarch64 explicitly require edk2-aarch64, remove it here.
