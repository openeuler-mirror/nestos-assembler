# Document Notes

- nestos-assembler is forked from [coreos-assembler](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler),most of the content in the original document can be referenced normally, and some keywords need to be replaced, such as replacing 'cosa' with 'nosa' and 'core' with 'nest'.

- The differences with the upstream version can be referred to in [changelog-compared-with-upstream.md](./changelog-compared-with-upstream.md)ã€‚

- Some interfaces are not available for NestOS, please refer to [Readme](../README.en.md) for details.

- We will gradually provide Chinese translations of some key documents in the future.
